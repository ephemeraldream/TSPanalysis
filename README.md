# TSPanalysis
Solving TSP using heuristic optimization algorithms. 

To run the the program run Main.py or the TSP_ANALYSIS.exe.

If running Main.py Python 3.7 and above is needed as well as the pandas library
which can be installed using pip:
    pyenv exec pip install pandas
or
    pip install pandas

Alternatively, the precompiled TSP_ANALYSIS.exe can be ran which does not have
a python or python module dependencies.

Once the program is started you are greeted with an autogenerated graph.
The graph can be zoomed into and panned around in (once zoomed in).
The bottom of the screen contains a few options, statistics, and text
fields which can be interacted with. The first option is the "solve" command
which will generate a solution with a given algorithm (none chosen initially).
